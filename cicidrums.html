        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <div class="about-me">
          <p><span class="hello"><em>Hello there!</em></span>  I've been playing the drums since I was 13 or so. I started after listening to a bunch of grunge music and deciding the drums would be the most fun to play. I was also rebelling against the piano lessons my mother made me take. I tried to get my friends to start a band in high school, but nobody would take it seriously enough.</p>
          <p>I joined my first band when I was in college, back in 2005 and have been playing in various bands ever since.</p>
